This bug occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions.  The issue arises when the app is run on a device with a notched display or a device that has rounded corners.  The `Dimensions.get('window')` method returns dimensions that do not account for the notch or rounded corners, leading to inaccurate layout calculations.  For example, if you use these dimensions to position a component, it might be partially hidden behind the notch or clipped by the rounded corners.
